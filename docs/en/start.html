             <h1>What is a provisioning tool?</h1>
             <p>
                 <span>When developing a system, there is work to be done on the server</span><br>
                 <span>Software installation and settings, user management, application deployment, data insert into the database, etc. . .</span><br>
                 <span>It automates the work on these servers and allows them to run on multiple servers</span><br>
                 <span>This page introduces a tool called <a href="https://fairysupport.com/run/index.html" target="_blank">fairy support run</a></span><br>
                 <span>Sample using fairy support run is uploaded <a href="https://github.com/fairysupport/run_sample" target="_blank">here</a>. Please use freely</span>

             <h1>The feature of the fairy support run</h1>
             <p>
                 <ol class="decimal-list">
                     <li>
                         <span>Installation is easy</span><br>
                         <span>It's downloaded and it's just put in the suitable place</span>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                         <span>There are no learning costs</span><br>
                         <span>To use fairy support run, write a shell</span><br>
                         <span>Anyone who can write shells can use it right away</span><br>
                         <span>Other provisioning tools use tool specific writing using YAML, JSON, etc</span><br>
                         <span>In that case, just rewrite the shell with the notation specific to each tool.</span><br>
                         <span>In fairy support run there is no cost to learn such a tool-specific notation</span>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                         <span>It doesn't become wasteful that it was learned</span><br>
                         <span>A few years later, you may switch to a new tool or you may use a different tool depending on where you moved</span><br>
                         <span>In that case, if you use a tool that writes in a specific notation, you will not be able to use the acquired knowledge</span><br>
                         <span>The only thing to remember when using fairy support run is the shell</span><br>
                         <span>Whatever tool is used in your assignment, that you remember a shell never becomes wasteful</span><br>
                         <span>You're unlikely to be in an environment where you can't use the shell in future engineer life</span><br>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                         <span>Existing assets can be reused</span><br>
                         <span>If you are currently assigned to a department that does not use a provisioning tool, you can use the shell which was written and saved formerly</span>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                         <span>The deliverables is not wasted/span><br>
                         <span>A few years later, you may switch to a new tool, or the version of the tool will rises, and the deliverables may become unusable</span><br>
                         <span>The only deliverables you create to use fairy support run is a shell. The shell itself works without fairy support run and can be used in the future</span>
                     </li>

                 <span>If you look at [run main.sh], you can see that main.sh was run</span><br>
                 <span>Looking at the displayed content, you can see that fairy support run is a very simple movement</span><br>
                 <span>Upload the file in the folder given by the argument, it automatically performs the task of running main.sh</span><br>
                 <span>That's all for the basic usage</span><br>
                 <span>In addition, there is a file download function, a function to upload other folders, a server.properties switching function, etc.</span><br>
